Hedgehog protein family in Serpentes

The hedgehog protein family is important for cell-cell signalling to direct cell differentiation during embryonic development in multicellular organisms. Snakes have three Hedgehog paralogs- Sonic, Desert, and Indian. A database was compiled of 8 Serpentes species each with all three paralogs. Sequences were found on NCBI GenBank.

Steps for data:
-Searched for python bivitattus hedgehog protein on NCBI GenBank
-Performed BLASTP on sequence against Serpentes
-Compiled nucleotide and amino acid information for blast results, excluding sequences labeled as "hypothetical" and species without all three paralogs
